# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Moulaymehdi
**Date:** 2025-12-29

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Knowledge extraction and mental model transfer from existing eRegistrations BPA to accelerate AI-Native BPA development

**Goals:** Design systematic approach to capture and transfer essential concepts, focusing innovation on AI novelties rather than rediscovering solved problems

### Key Resources
- Existing BPA API: https://bpa.dev.els.eregistrations.org/bparest/bpa/v2016/06/v3/api-docs

### Session Setup

**Key Tensions Identified:**
- 🧠 **Knowledge Gap** — The new project risks missing battle-tested patterns
- ⚡ **Innovation Focus** — Energy should go to AI-native features, not basics
- 🔄 **Transfer Problem** — Extract concepts without blindly copying implementation

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Knowledge extraction from existing BPA, focusing on paradigm transfer to AI-native

**Recommended Techniques:**

1. **First Principles Thinking:** Strip implementation details to find fundamental BPA truths
2. **Question Storming:** Generate strategic questions before diving into API docs
3. **Cross-Pollination:** Transfer extracted patterns to AI-native paradigm

**AI Rationale:** This sequence moves from deep extraction → strategic framing → paradigm bridging, ensuring we capture the "juice" without copying implementation baggage.

## Technique Execution Results

### First Principles Thinking

**Interactive Focus:** Stripping away implementation to reveal fundamental BPA truths

**Key Breakthroughs:**

1. **BPA is Meta-Infrastructure**
   - Design-time configuration tool, not runtime processing
   - Creates rules that others play by

2. **Core Concepts Extracted:**
   - **Registration** = Authorization container (data + docs + fees → authorization)
   - **Role** = Processing state (executor + interface + 4-status outcome)
   - **4-Status Model** = Universal workflow grammar (pending/passed/returned/rejected)

3. **Contract > Implementation Pattern:**
   - BOTs should be contract-based (standard I/O), not type-based
   - Enables plug & play architecture
   - AI agents, payment processors, legacy APIs = different implementations of same contracts

4. **AI-Native Evolutions:**
   - Forms → Conversations
   - Linear role sequences → Dynamic routing based on context
   - Type-based BOTs → Contract-based processors

**Fundamental Insight:**
> From "follow this sequence" → "achieve this outcome, route intelligently"
