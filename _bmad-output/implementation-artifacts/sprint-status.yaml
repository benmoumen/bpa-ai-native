# Story Location: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#   - superseded: Epic merged into other epics or deferred
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created, ready for development
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Implementation complete, ready for review
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed

# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Mark epic as 'in-progress' when starting work on its first story
# - SM typically creates next story ONLY after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then Dev runs code-review (fresh context, ideally different LLM)

# STRATEGIC UPDATE (2026-01-01):
# ==============================
# - Epic 5 superseded: Stories merged into Epic 4 and Phase 2
# - Added spike stories (4-0, 6-0) for domain research before complex epics
# - Reordered MVP path: Epic 4 → Epic 6-core → Epic 7 → Epic 6-advanced
# - Epic 4 stories prioritized: 4-1 to 4-6 and 4-9 are MVP critical
